Welcome to the **numspell** wiki!

If you'd like to contribute to the project then you have come to the right place.

Start by reading the [[Developer Introduction]] which describes the goals, design decisions and high-level architecture of the project.

The various components of the **numspell** module are covered in the following documents:

* [[Spelling Algorithm]] outlines the steps of the spelling algorithm and explains how each step is implemented.

* [[Rule Syntax]] explains the syntax for defining rules by which a number is decomposed into logical elements.

* [[Template Syntax]] explains the template string syntax used by the **listparse** submodule. It allows to transform the logical elements of a number to adjust for possible exceptions and irregularities of a particular human language.
